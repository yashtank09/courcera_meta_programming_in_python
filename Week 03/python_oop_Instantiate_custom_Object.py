    Exercise: Instantiate a custom Object
        This is your first experience creating classes and objects in Python.
        You will be following a sequential process where you will create a class, define its state by creating variables and functions to define its attributes and behavior, and then instantiate it using some variable.
        Finally, you will use the class members to get the desired output.

    Follow the steps to build and run your program in the environment provided at the bottom of the reading.

    Step 1
        1.1 Define a class called MyFirstClass.

        1.2 Add a print statement inside it such as “Who wrote this?”.

    Step 2
        Create a string variable named index and initialize it with a string “Author-Book”.

    Step 3
        3.1 Define a function called hand_list() with the help of def keyword.

        3.2 Pass the parameter  self to it. And then pass two parameters, philosopher and book to it.

    Step 4
        4.1 Write a print statement using the print() function and pass the class variable by accessing it.

        Hint: Class variables are accessed directly by calling it over the class name using dot notation.

        4.2 Write a print statement that will give output such as: “Plato wrote the book: Republic” where “Plato” is the philosopher and “Republic” is the book.

        Hint: You can make use of the built-in (+) concatenation operator to join these strings.

    Step 5
        5.1 Create and instantiate an object of that class, called whodunnit

        5.2 Call method hand_list() over this object “whodunnit” and pass two values to it namely “Sun Tzu” and “The Art of War”.

# Define class MyFirstClass
class MyFirstClass:
    print("Who wrote this?")

    # Define string variable called index
    index = "Author-book"

    # Define function hand_list()
    def hand_list(self, philosopher, book):
        # variable + “ wrote the book: ” + variable
        print(self.index)
        print(philosopher + " wrote the book: " + book)


# Call function handlist()
whodunnit = MyFirstClass()
whodunnit.hand_list("Sun Tzu", "The Art of War")
