Mirae Emerging Bluechip Fund belongs to the Large & Mid Cap category, and so, it has the mandate to invest at least 35% of its corpus in large-cap stocks and another 35% in mid-caps.
In a way, a sizable corpus of this fund needs to be invested in companies that are on a high growth path and have the potential to become bluechip companies going forward.
